# Python-LinearRegression
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.


What is linear regression? Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.![linear regression](https://github.com/RoshaSoft/Python-LinearRegression/assets/85801966/1816d822-6a05-4c14-bbc3-d6bfedf674a1)
